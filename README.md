# multinational-retail-data-centralisation
This project is the Multinational Data Centralisation project, which is a comprehensive project aimed at transforming and analysing large datasets from multiple data sources. By utilising the power of Pandas, the project cleans the data, and produces a STAR based database schema for optimised data storage and access. The project also builds complex SQL-based data queries, allowing the user to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions. This project provided me with the experience of building a real-life complete data solution, from data acquisition to analysis, all in one place.
